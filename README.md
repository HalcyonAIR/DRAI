# Dynamic Resonance AI (DRAI)
*Phase-Synchronized Learning Beyond Backpropagation*

DRAI is a biologically inspired, resonance-based learning framework that replaces global error propagation with local oscillatory synchronization. Instead of using backpropagation, DRAI strengthens or weakens synaptic connections based on phase alignment between dynamic neural oscillators. This enables energy-efficient, fully local, and self-organizing learning—ideal for neuromorphic computing, adaptive robotics, and real-time AI systems operating at the edge.

## Key Concepts
- Neurons are modeled as phase-driven oscillators
- Synaptic weights update through natural resonance, not global gradients
- Synchrony = strength, desynchrony = decay
- Strong resistance to noise and catastrophic forgetting
- Excellent fit for analog, event-driven, and distributed architectures

## Why It Matters
Backpropagation is powerful but biologically implausible and computationally expensive. DRAI offers a new approach—one inspired by real neural timing, built for emergent synchronization, and designed for decentralized cognition. It scales down efficiently and learns as it moves.
